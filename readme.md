## Work-in-progress
###### 1.0.0.alpha

### Components
All components are created with Vue. If you want to build a component for this repo,
use the same structure as the rest of the components**.

#### Component wishes
- Still missing 3 modules to complete the personal build
- Calendar for today (google, apple)
   
Currently also waiting for microphone, speaker and motion sensor.

Need to write documentation for repo and usage.
